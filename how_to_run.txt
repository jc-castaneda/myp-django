1. Install Django (can do it in a virtual environment or just in the command line):
    `pip install django`
2. Set environment variables: Although not required, you can set PIPELINE=local as an environment variable. This tells Django to use the local setup for the backend instead of using the remote database
3. Locally host the backend: Type
    `py manage.py runserver`
   in the root directory. This hosts the backend on localhost:8000
4. Run the react frontend: In a separate terminal, navigate to the 'reactapp' folder and run
    `npm run start`
   This hosts the frontend on localhost:3000
5. In the frontend, you should be able to navigate to localhost:3000/users
6. There's probably a better way of doing this in the future, but to create a user, send a post request to the backend by pasting the following code into the console in your web browser:

	fetch('http://localhost:8000/api/register/', {
	  method: 'POST',
	  headers: {
	    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
	  },
	  body: JSON.stringify({
	  	username: "TestUser1",
	  	password: "Pass1",
	  	email: "user1@gmail.com",
	  	bio: "Sample bio",
	  	skills: ["skill 1", "skill 2"],
	  	interests: ["interest 1", "interest 2"],
	  	user_type: "Producer"
	  })
	})
